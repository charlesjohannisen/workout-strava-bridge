# Apple Workout to Strava Export app
This is a very niche app.

It applies if: 
- You are a Discovery Vitality member
- Use the Apple Watch for workouts and want to get max points by using the Workout app
- and also use Strava and want to upload your activity to Strava

Using the Strava app on your watch will get you the minimum amount of points, because the Strava app is considered a third-party app.

The code is written for iPhone 6.
